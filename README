Intructions on building likewise-open
=====================================

The likewise-open build is driven by a series of shell scripts.  While
the code is portable among a variety of *nix based platforms (Linux, Solaris,
AIX, HP-UX, and OS X), this build system is primarily intended for Linux
platforms.

The easist way to begin a build is to run:

  $ build/mkcomp all

This will the necessary components and install them to the staging/install-root/
directory.  

You may then create a set of packages by executing (currently only debs
are supported)

  $ build/mkpkg all
