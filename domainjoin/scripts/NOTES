# mono --version gives this error on Solaris/sparc on stderr:
#
# GLib: Cannot convert message: Conversion from character set 'UTF-8' to '646' is not supported

# LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 seems to solve it.  However, we do not want to
# force any en_US-ness and don't have time to invest further.
# Therefore, for now, we just 2>/dev/null to get rid of stderr output.
