                          README File for Likewise Open 5.2
                          =================================

Likewise Open has several goals:

(a) Simply the process of joining non-Microsoft hosts to Active Directory
    domains,
(b) Simply the management of these hosts, and
(c) Provide a rich development platform for writing applications in
    heterogeneous networks.

We hope you find this software useful.

Instructions on building likewise-open
======================================

The likewise-open build is driven by a series of shell scripts.
While the code is portable among a variety of *nix based platforms
(Linux, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, and OS X), this build system is 
primarily intended for Linux platforms.

Before you begin, please read over this list of prerequisite packages
(depending on your Linux distro):

    * RedHat/Fedora - gcc, autoconf, automake, e2fsprogrs-devel,
      pam-devel, ncurses-devel, flex, bison, rpm-build, rpm-devel

      Optional packages: 
         o libglade2-devel - To build domainjoin-gui GTK application
         o libattr-devel   - To enable extended attribute support for the 
                             Likewise CIFS server (experimental)

    * Ubuntu - build-essential, fakeroot, devscripts, debhelper,
      autoconf, automake, libtool, libncurses5-dev, uuid-dev,
      flex, bison, libpam0g-dev

      Optional packages: 
         o libglade2-dev - To build domainjoin-gui GTK application
         o libattr1-dev  - To enable extended attribute support for the 
                           Likewise CIFS server (experimental)

    * SLES/SLED/openSUSE - TDB

The easiest way to begin a build is to run:

  $ build/mkcomp all

This will the necessary components and install them to the 
staging/install-root/ directory.  

You may then create a set of packages by executing (currently only
debs are supported)

  $ build/mkpkg all

Both mkcomp and mkpkg support the --debug option for including
(and not tripping) debug symbols.
