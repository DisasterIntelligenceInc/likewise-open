1 Introduction
**************

As with most software upgrades, Kerberos V5 is generally backward
compatible but not necessarily forward compatible.  The Kerberos V5
daemons can interoperate with Kerberos V4 clients, but most of the
Kerberos V4 daemons can not interoperate with Kerberos V5 clients.  This
suggests the following strategy for performing the upgrade:

  1. *Upgrade your KDCs.*  This must be done first, so that
     interactions with the Kerberos database, whether by Kerberos V5
     clients or by Kerberos V4 clients, will succeed.

  2. *Upgrade your servers.*  This must be done before upgrading client
     machines, so that the servers are able to respond to both Kerberos
     V5 and Kerberos V4 queries.

  3. *Upgrade your client machines.*  Do this only after your KDCs and
     application servers are upgraded, so that all of your Kerberos V5
     clients will be talking to Kerberos V5 daemons.


File: krb425.info,  Node: Configuration Files,  Next: Upgrading KDCs,  Prev: Introduction,  Up: Top

2 Configuration Files
*********************

The Kerberos `krb5.conf' and KDC `kdc.conf' configuration files allow
additional tags for Kerberos V4 compatibility.

* Menu:

* krb5.conf::
* kdc.conf::


File: krb425.info,  Node: krb5.conf,  Next: kdc.conf,  Prev: Configuration Files,  Up: Configuration Files

2.1 krb5.conf
=============

If you used the defaults, both when you installed Kerberos V4 and when
you installed Kerberos V5, you should not need to include any of these
tags.  However, some or all of them may be necessary for nonstandard
installations.

* Menu:

* libdefaults::
* realms (krb5.conf)::
* AFS and the Appdefaults Section::


File: krb425.info,  Node: libdefaults,  Next: realms (krb5.conf),  Prev: krb5.conf,  Up: krb5.conf

2.1.1 [libdefaults]
-------------------

In the [libdefaults] section, the following additional tags may be used:

krb4_srvtab
     Specifies the location of the Kerberos V4 srvtab file.  Default is
     /etc/srvtab.

krb4_config
     Specifies the location of the Kerberos V4 configuration file.
     Default is /etc/krb.conf.

krb4_realms
     Specifies the location of the Kerberos V4 domain/realm translation
     file.  Default is /etc/krb.realms.


File: krb425.info,  Node: realms (krb5.conf),  Next: AFS and the Appdefaults Section,  Prev: libdefaults,  Up: krb5.conf

2.1.2 [realms]
--------------

In the [realms] section, the following Kerberos V4 tags may be used:
default_domain
     Identifies the default domain for hosts in this realm.  This is
     needed for translating V4 principal names (which do not contain a
     domain name) to V5 principal names.  The default is your Kerberos
     realm name, converted to lower case.

v4_instance_convert
     This subsection allows the administrator to configure exceptions
     to the default_domain mapping rule.  It contains V4 instances (tag
     name) which should be translated to some specific hostname (tag
     value) as the second component in a Kerberos V5 principal name.

v4_realm
     This relation allows the administrator to configure a different
     realm name to be used when converting V5 principals to V4 ones.
     This should only be used when running separate V4 and V5 realms,
     with some external means of password sychronization between the
     realms.



File: krb425.info,  Node: AFS and the Appdefaults Section,  Prev: realms (krb5.conf),  Up: krb5.conf

2.1.3 AFS and the Appdefaults Section
-------------------------------------

Many Kerberos 4 sites also run the Andrew File System (AFS).

Modern AFS servers (OpenAFS > 1.2.8) support the AFS 2b token format.
This allows AFS to use Kerberos 5 tickets rather than version 4
tickets, enabling cross-realm authentication.  By default, the
`krb524d' service will issue the new AFS 2b tokens.  If you are using
old AFS servers, you will need to disable these new tokens.  Please see
the documentation of the `appdefaults' section of `krb5.conf' in the
Kerberos Administration guide.


File: krb425.info,  Node: kdc.conf,  Prev: krb5.conf,  Up: Configuration Files

2.2 kdc.conf
============

Because Kerberos V4 requires a different type of salt for the encryption
type, you will need to change the `supported_enctypes' line in the
[realms] section to:

     supported_enctypes = des-cbc-crc:normal des-cbc-crc:v4

This is the only change needed to the `kdc.conf' file.


File: krb425.info,  Node: Upgrading KDCs,  Next: Upgrading Application Servers,  Prev: Configuration Files,  Up: Top

3 Upgrading KDCs
****************

To convert your KDCs from Kerberos V4 to Kerberos V5, do the following:

  1. Install Kerberos V5 on each KDC, according to the instructions in
     the Kerberos V5 Installation Guide, up to the point where it tells
     you to create the database.

  2. Find the `kadmind' (V4) daemon process on the master KDC and kill
     it.  This will prevent changes to the Kerberos database while you
     convert the database to the new Kerberos V5 format.

  3. Create a dump of the V4 database in the directory where your V5
     database will reside by issuing the command:

          % kdb_util dump /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/v4-dump

  4. Load the V4 dump into a Kerberos V5 database, by issuing the
     command:

          % kdb5_util load_v4 v4-dump

  5. Create a Kerberos V5 stash file, if desired, by issuing the
     command:

          % kdb5_util stash

  6. Proceed with the rest of the Kerberos V5 installation as described
     in the Kerberos V5 Installation Guide.  When you get to the section
     that tells you to start the `krb5kdc' and `kadmind' daemons, first
     find and kill the Kerberos V4 `kerberos' daemon on each of the
     KDCs.  Then start the `krb5kdc' and `kadmind' daemons as You will
     need to specify an argument to the `-4' command line option to
     enable Kerberos 4 compatibility.  See the `krb5kdc' man page for
     details.  directed.  Finally, start the Kerberos V5 to V4 ticket
     translator daemon, `krb524d', by issuing the command:

          % /usr/local/sbin/krb524d -m > /dev/null &

     If you have a stash file and you start the `krb5kdc' and `kadmind'
     daemons at boot time, you should add the above line to your
     `/etc/rc' (or `/etc/rc.local') file on each KDC.

4 Upgrading Application Servers
*******************************

Install Kerberos V5 on each application server, according to the
instructions in the Kerberos V5 Installation Guide, with the following
exceptions:

   * In the file `/etc/services', add or edit the lines described in the
     Kerberos V5 Installation Guide, with the following exception:

     in place of:

          kerberos      88/udp    kdc    # Kerberos V5 KDC
          kerberos      88/tcp    kdc    # Kerberos V5 KDC

     add instead:

          kerberos-sec  88/tcp    kdc    # Kerberos V5 KDC

   * Convert your Kerberos V4 srvtab file to Kerberos V5 keytab file as
     follows:

          # /usr/local/sbin/ktutil
          ktutil:  rst /etc/krb-srvtab
          ktutil:  wkt /etc/krb5.keytab

5 Upgrading Client machines
***************************

Install Kerberos V5 on each client machine, according to the
instructions in the Kerberos V5 Installation Guide.

Tell your users to add the appropriate directory to their paths.  On
UNIX machines, this will probably be `/usr/local/bin'.

Note that if you upgrade your client machines before all of your
application servers are upgraded, your users will need to use the
Kerberos V4 programs to connect to application servers that are still
running Kerberos V4.  (The one exception is the UNIX version of
Kerberos V5 telnet, which can connect to a Kerberos V4 and Kerberos V5
application servers.)  Users can use either the Kerberos V4 or Kerberos
V5 programs to connect to Kerberos V5 servers.

6 Firewall Considerations
*************************

Kerberos V5 uses port 88, which is the port assigned by the IETF, for
KDC requests.  Kerberos V4 used port 750.  If your users will need to
get to any KDCs outside your firewall, you will need to allow TCP and
UDP requests on port 88 for your users to get to off-site Kerberos V5
KDCs, and on port 750 for your users to get to off-site Kerberos V4
KDCs.
