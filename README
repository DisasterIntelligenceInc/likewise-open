                          README File for Likewise Open 5.3
                          =================================

Likewise Open has several goals:

(a) Simply the process of joining non-Microsoft hosts to Active Directory
    domains,
(b) Simply the management of these hosts, and
(c) Provide a rich development platform for writing applications in
    heterogeneous networks.

We hope you find this software useful.

Instructions on building likewise-open
======================================

The likewise-open build is driven by a series of shell scripts.
While the code is portable among a variety of *nix based platforms
(Linux, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, and OS X), this build system is 
primarily intended for Linux platforms.

Before you begin, please read over this list of prerequisite packages
(depending on your Linux distro):

    * RedHat/Fedora - gcc, autoconf, automake, e2fsprogrs-devel,
      pam-devel, ncurses-devel, flex, bison, rpm-build, rpm-devel,
      openssl-devel

      Optional packages: 
         o libglade2-devel - To build domainjoin-gui GTK application
         o libattr-devel   - To enable extended attribute support for the 
                             Likewise CIFS server (experimental)

    * Ubuntu - build-essential, fakeroot, devscripts, debhelper,
      autoconf, automake, libtool, libncurses5-dev, uuid-dev,
      flex, bison, libpam0g-dev, libssl-dev

      Optional packages: 
         o libglade2-dev - To build domainjoin-gui GTK application
         o libattr1-dev  - To enable extended attribute support for the 
                           Likewise CIFS server (experimental)

    * SLES/SLED/openSUSE - TDB

The easiest way to begin a build is to run:

  $ build/mkcomp all

This will the necessary components and install them to the 
staging/install-root/ directory.  

You may then create a set of packages by executing (currently only
debs are supported)

  $ build/mkpkg all

Both mkcomp and mkpkg support the --debug option for including
(and not tripping) debug symbols.

The Likewise CIFS Server (in development)
=========================================

We are implementing a full SMBv1 and SMBv2 protocol stack in the 
Likewise I/O Manager.  Some overview information is available at 
http://www.likewiseopen.org/.

Be warned that the server represents active design and development.  It is
not recommended in any way for production use at this time.  If you are
interested in track Likewise development or just experimenting with upcoming
release feature, please note that the server drivers  (srv.sys.so, 
pvfs.sys.so, and npvfs.sys.so) are disabled in /etc/likewise/lwiod.conf by
default.  You will need to uncomment these drivers and restart lwiod.
You will also want to start the srvsvcd daemon which allow the MMC
share manager plugin to work against lwiod.

Finally, the C$ share exports the /lwtest directory.  You will need to
create this path on you server.

More details about the server architecture can be found in the Likewise
presentation at this past year's Samba XP conference.  The slides
are duplicated at http://archives.likewiseopen.org/~gcarter/presentations/.

This following is a short list of known issues in the Likewise CIFS 
server:

  * Only supports operation when joined to an AD domain.
  * No interaction with POSIX file permissions (uses Extended Attributes
    for storing the Windows security descriptor).
  * No support for oplocks or directory notification
  * Incomplete SMBv1 (NTLM 0.12) command set
  * ...

That said, I am using the server for roaming user profiles, iTunes media
libraries, network home directories, "My Documents" redirection, and other
fundamental file services on a daily basis.
