There are two ways of building DEBs for likewise-open:

1.  If you are working in a git branch, run "make dpkg" from the 
    top level of the repository.

2.  If you are using an official source release, run the following
    two commands  from the top level of the extracted archive:

      $ ln -s packaging/debian debian
      $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

Both should created a set of debs in the parent directory that can be
installed on the local system.
